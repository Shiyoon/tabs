        <div class="description active" id="appearance"><p>She is a white bunny that wears a dark pink hood that covers her ears. 
            <br>The left one is usually in a down position and the right one has a white or light pink flower with a yellow center. 
            <br>She has white fur and a yellow nose.</p></div>
        <div class="description" id="personality"><p>My Melody is kind, sociable, optimistic, and calm, unlike her rival Kuromi. She is also very blunt and often quotes advice given to her by her mom. This advice can be painfully forward. She can never read the mood of a room, according to Kuromi. She's often oblivious to many things, including Kuromi's intentions of rivalry. She is a hard worker that finishes what other people started.</p></div>
        <div class="description" id="powers"><p>Although she has no powers by herself, she uses the Melody Takt (a conductor's baton-like item) to bring inanimate figures to life. She says "Onegai, [the subject]?" or "Melody... Mark!" to make it more powerful, or add pretty please with sugar on top, to make the object stronger. When he or she finishes his or her job, she gives him or her a Melody Candy and they automatically turn back to their normal form.</p></div>
        <div class="description" id="friends"><p>My Melody's younger brother Rhythm can be a little bit of a rascal, but she loves him dearly, Her older sister Harmony can be kind, honest and smart to her, even she loves her too. Her mama enjoys doing crafts and loves baking cookies with her. Her gentle, strong papa must be where she gets her kind disposition. Her treasured hood was made just for her by her very knowledgeable grandma, while her grandpa loves adventures!

            She is best friends with Flat, a blue mouse who is a bit shy, and My Sweet Piano, a pink sheep who is soft, kind and girly.
            
            My Melody's rival is Kuromi. My Melody has warm feelings for Kuromi, but Kuromi is inclined toward rivalry to look tough.</p></div>
